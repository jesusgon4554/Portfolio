                <p>My name is Jesus Gonzalez and I am a Junior Web Developer from Ontario, California.
                   I am 20 years old and graduated from Chaffey Hight School in 2018. Throughout high 
                   school I enjoyed playing music, which I was apart of the marching band as a trumpet
                   player. I would also spend time in the computer science club where I learned the fundamentals
                   of Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                   After graduation I decided to enlist in the United States Marine Corps, I knew 
                   that I would want to continue my education in Computer Science so I decided to
                   join the reserves. With my love towards computers I also shared a fascination With
                   space and aviation. I enlisted as an avionics technician on the UH-1Y and AH-1Z. After 
                   9 months on schooling I learned a lot about electronics, electricity, and components 
                   on the aircraft. This gave me more of an understanding of what goes on beyond the code
                   being implemented and how it plays with electricity.
                </p>  
                <p>
                   Upon graduating my MOS school I eventually checked into my unit and came home to where
                   I began my college studies at Mt. San Antonio College in computer science as well as my job at Amazon. 
                   I am beginning my second year and going to get ready to transfer next fall. During my Spring
                   semester I took an intro to programming in Java which felt like a breeze because of my previous
                   experience of coding in python, as well as studying the fundamentals throughout my time in the Marines.
                   I aced the class and am moving into object-oriented and eventually data structures.
                </p>  
                  
                   I always wanted to take a coding boot camp to get ahead of the curve and kick start my career
                   with a certificate and a good foundation, after doing research on multiple boot camps
                   I found this one to be more beneficial as well as affordable becuase of Amazon. After this course
                   I hope to have an understanding where I hopefully land a great job and keep learning new languages and areas of study
                   to where I can land a job in a space background such as SpaceX or Nasa.
                </p>
